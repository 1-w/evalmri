3.  Kilpatrick et al. 2003: [Preoperative evaluation for temporal lobe surgery](<https://doi.org/10.1016/S0967-5868(03)00080-8>)

    Factors relevant for seizure outcome:

      1. MRI

      (lateralized and concordant / discordant / non-leteralized) with MRI:

      2. Ictal EEG
      3. Inter-Ictal EEG
      4. Seizure semiology
      5. FDG-PET
      6. Neuropsychology


    Cohort: 80

    "The outcome from surgery was not significantly different in those patients with a concordant lateralised result compared with those with discordant or non-lateralising result for any of the preoperative evaluations. This result may in part reflect surgical selection bias where patients in whom the ictal EEG showed a clearcut seizure onset contralateral to the MRI epileptogenic lesion were not offered surgery."
